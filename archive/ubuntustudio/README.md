# Ubuntu Studio's Calamares Branding (archived)

This directory houses the branding Ubuntu Studio used when Calamares was still
being used as the installer, along with some additional potentially useful
configuration fragments. Ubuntu Studio has since switched to using
ubuntu-desktop-provision, and thus most of the actual configuration has been
removed.
